Exploring Sales Dynamics, Regional Variations, and Profitability in Adidas Retail Operations. I present a thorough examination of Adidas' retail operations, shedding light on various aspects of their sales strategies, geographical distribution, and financial outcomes.

## Introduction
An Adidas sales dataset is a collection of data that includes information on the sales of Adidas products. This dataset includes details such as the number of units sold, the total sales revenue, the location of the sales, the type of product sold, and any other relevant information. Adidas sales data can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as analyzing sales trends, identifying successful products or marketing campaigns, and developing strategies for future sales. It can also be used to compare Adidas sales to those of competitors or to analyze the effectiveness of different marketing or sales channels.

For problem 1, Calculate the total sales for each retailer in the table. <br>
By grouping the data based on retailers and summing up their total sales, we gain an understanding of which retailers have generated higher sales volumes. This allows us to easily compare the sales performance of different retailers. Retailers with higher total sales are likely to be more successful in terms of revenue generation. <br>

2. Determine the total units sold for each product category and Identify the product with the lowest total units sold. <br>
This analysis helps distinguish between product categories that are performing exceptionally well and those that might need improvement. Categories with high units sold are likely popular among customers, while those with low units sold might require attention. <br>
